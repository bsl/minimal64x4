# Minimal64x4 BOM

When I was building my Minimal64x4, one of the most difficult and
time-consuming parts was finding and ordering all the components. You can
probably save a lot of time by importing this file in the shopping cart of
Mouser or whatever parts supplier you use.

Note, this BOM is not optimized. It's probably possible to choose cheaper parts
that will work fine. That's part of the reason I'm putting it here. Please
submit improvements!
